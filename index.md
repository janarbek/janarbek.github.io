I am a Principal Software engineer at 3D Engineering department of [Cognex Corporation](https://www.cognex.com/). Around 2015, I completed my PhD in Computer Science from the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) department of [UCSD](https://www.ucsd.edu). I was a Masters stdudent at ICU (Information and Communications University) which is now part of [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/index.html). 
I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the [Mongolian University of Science and Technology](http://www.must.edu.mn/eng/). 

Other than my current job, I worked for Computer Science and Engineering department of University of California San Diego as a lecturer and an adjunct professor. I also worked for [ETRI](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri) as a researcher for a couple of years. 

My general interests are applications of FPGA and GPU on machine learning, computer vision and big data.  I am also interested in computer arhciecture and high performance computing.
