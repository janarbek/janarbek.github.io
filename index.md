I work for Qualcomm AI Research, and I work in several interesting and interrelated areas. My primary goal is to make computer vision/machine learning workloads efficient either by designing hardware accelerators or 
making the models more efficient. I have initiated a 3D computer vision team focusing on efficiency within Qualcomm AI. I am also the founder of the hw-sw co-design team for efficient ML. 
I have worked extensively with Universities ([UCSD Visual Computing Center](http://visualcomputing.ucsd.edu/) and [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/)) for joint projects which (some of them I initiated) resulted in fruitful collaborations.  

Previously, I was a Principal Software engineer at the 3D Engineering department of [Cognex Corporation](https://www.cognex.com/). Around 2015, I completed my PhD in Computer Science from the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) department of [UCSD](https://www.ucsd.edu). I was a Masters's student at ICU (Information and Communications University) which is now part of [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/index.html). 
I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the [Mongolian University of Science and Technology](http://www.must.edu.mn/eng/). 

Other than my current job, I occasionally teach at the Computer Science and Engineering department of the University of California San Diego as a lecturer and an adjunct professor. A long time ago I was in South Korea where I worked for [ETRI](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri) as a researcher for a couple of years. 

My general interests are applications of hw acceleration of ML (3D, deep earning, ML), tinyML, ML-based ISP, and computer vision, deep learning compilers.  I am also interested in computer architecture and high-performance computing.
